### A tiny review of dating apps
This is a small essay reviewing location-based dating apps and its users, and the effects on the mental state of the users. I intend to do a very short literature review, and write more about my own experience with the apps as well.

For a while now, dating and finding people to build a relationship, has moved to the digital arena. While digitally aided dating has had some history since 1959, most of the early experiments were more to match paying users with each other via computer. This evolved into internet based apps, which in 2006 saw the breakthrough of introducing location-based matching. For masc-coded queer people today, the to-go app is of course Grindr, which is an app that was released in 2009, and mainly focuses on casual meetings with strangers close to a user. Grindr itself is a very popular app, being in the West the most popular among its target demographic, and one of the most overall. I have myself used the app (and others), and have found it very wanting. For this essay I try to understand what people expect on these apps, how they feel about the apps, and what this might tell us about what kinds of subjects these apps are meant to generate.

### Aspects of Surrogacy in India
In 2021, at the end of a long process of discussion on the topic, the Indian government decided (and managed after some years of administrative confusion) to ban commercial surrogacy in India. Before then, from 2012, Surrogacy was made legal and minimally regulated. But with the passing of two bills, Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act of 2021 and Surrogacy Regulation Act of 2021, commercial surrogacy has been made illegal, and the only form of gestational surrogacy now legally allowed is “altruistic”, that is to say essentially for free. I argue here that on one hand, this makes it harder to manage the exploitation of women, and on the other hand it further informalizes gestational workers, leaving them in very precarious situations. I continue with recommendations for continuing to see gestational workers as workers, and to improve working conditions for them, and I end with some response to moral arguments in this field.

### On Museums, Power, Discipline, and Subjects - A review and partial case study based in NGMA, Bangalore
I discuss a field visit to NGMA bangalore, and some literature that connects to what I observed. . I discuss a few aspects of museums, power and subjectivities in four parts:  history and logics of museums, nationalism and the subjectivities engendered, discipline and self-discipline, and possibilities of dissent. In each section, I try to compare and contrast the literature with my observations from my field visit. I then conclude with a small section on further work.
